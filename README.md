# Authorizit

Authorizit is a simple and flexible resource focused authorization library. In other words it is about resources and possible actions to perform over them (based or not in additional conditions).
A simple and usefull example would be a user that can edit(action) a post(resource) if(condition) it is his post.

It was hardly inspired on [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/) a RubyOnRails gem.

For now, it has just the basic functionality of authorizing the resources as you can check in the [example](https://github.com/pedrofs/authorizit/blob/master/example/example.php) inside the example dir.
